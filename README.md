## Overview

Bamazon is a CLI app that uses Node.js and MySQL to interact as a amazon-like storefront.  Orders can be placed and the inventory can be affected by the customers.

## Customer

To run the Bamazon Customer file , you begin with a simple node command: `node bamazonCustomer.js` .

From there a table is opened up for the customer to view: 

## Opening Screen
<img src= "/bcustomer.png" alt= "Customer Opening Screen>

The customer is prompted to:
* select the ID of the product they wish to purchase
* followed by how many units they would like to buy

Once the database has been checked for availabilty, the customer is presented with:
* cost of their purchase
* how many of the items are still remaining in stock

The customer is also prompted to make another purchase if they wish at which point an updated table is presented to the customer.

**If they do not the program exits.**

Enjoy Shopping!!!! :raised_hands: :gift:
